<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
<p>
  In this project, I implemented a renderer that uses raytracing to produce
  realistic images of scenes. This renderer uses bounding volume hierarchies
  and adaptive sampling to reduce render times. It can render scenes that
  contain point or area lights, as well as models that have diffuse materials
  (Lambertian surfaces).
</p>

<h2 align="middle">Part 1: Ray Generation and Scene Intersection</h2>
<!-- Walk through the ray generation and primitive intersection parts of the rendering pipeline.
Explain the triangle intersection algorithm you implemented in your own words.
Show images with normal shading for a few small .dae files. -->

<h3>
  Walk through the ray generation and primitive intersection parts of the rendering pipeline.
</h3>
<p>
  To generate a camera ray in <i>Camera::generate_ray()</i>, I first calculate
  the coordinates of the lower left corner of the virtual camera sensor,
  as well as the width and height of the sensor rectangle. Then, I can
  convert from the given normalized image space coordinates \((x, y)\) to the coordinates
  \((xCamera, yCamera)\) in camera-space using scale proportions. I use the
  camera’s position and the camera-to-world rotation matrix \(c2w\) to transform
  the ray's origin and direction to world-space. After normalizing the ray’s
  direction vector, I return a new ray with the world-space origin and direction,
  with the minimum and maximum \(t\) values set to \(nClip\) and \(fClip\).

  <br><br>

  To raytrace a single pixel in the rendering pipeline in <i>PathTracer::raytrace_pixel()</i>,
  I generate \(num_samples\) camera rays and use Monte Carlo estimation to
  estimate the integral of radiance over the given pixel. To sample from a
  uniform distribution over a unit square, I use the PathTracer’s \(gridSampler\);
  then, I add the random sample to the bottom left corner of the pixel \((x, y)\) to get
  a random point inside the pixel. I generate the camera ray corresponding to
  this random point and add its radiance contribution to my Monte Carlo estimator.
  After all \(num_samples\) samples, I update the pixel’s value in \(sampleBuffer\).

</p>
<br>

<h3>
  Explain the triangle intersection algorithm you implemented.
</h3>
<p>
  To test for intersection of a ray with a primitive, I substitute
  the ray equation \(O + td\) into the implicit formula of the geometric
  object (which could be a triangle or a sphere) and solve for the value of \(t\).
  For my triangle intersection algorithm, I use the M&#246ller-Trumbore Algorithm
  to optimize solving for the intersection point. If the computed value of
  \(t\) lies within the ray’s range of \([min\_t, max\_t]\) and
  each coordinate-value of the intersection point’s barycentric
  coordinates is in the range \([0, 1]\), then the ray intersects the triangle.
  In the case of intersection, I update the <i>Intersection</i> data object accordingly.

<h3>
  Walk through your BVH construction algorithm. Explain the heuristic you chose for picking the splitting point.
</h3>
<p>
  For my BVH construction algorithm in <i>BVHAccel::construct_bvh()</i>,
  I first compute the bounding box of the given list of primitives and
  initialize a BVHNode with the bounding box. If the number of objects
  in the node is less than or equal to the \(max_leaf_size\), the node is a leaf
  and I return it. Otherwise, I recursively build the left and right children.
  <br><br>
  The heuristic I use for the splitting point is the average of centroids along the
  longest axis of the bounding box. I find the longest axis by examining the bounding
  box’s <i>extent</i> member. Then, I sort the primitives according to
  which side of the splitting point they fall on, by iterating through the
  primitives and swapping elements by keeping track of a pointer to
  the end of the left child’s elements. If all the elements are sorted into one
  child, I decide that the node is a leaf node and terminate early.

<!-- Walk through both implementations of the direct lighting function.
Show some images rendered with both implementations of the direct lighting function.
Focus on one particular scene with at least one area light and compare the noise levels in soft shadows when rendering with 1, 4, 16, and 64 light rays (the -l flag) and with 1 sample per pixel (the -s flag) using light sampling, not uniform hemisphere sampling.
Compare the results between uniform hemisphere sampling and lighting sampling in a one-paragraph analysis. -->

<h3>
  Walk through both implementations of the direct lighting function.
</h3>
<p>
  For uniform hemisphere lighting, I take \(num_samples\) number of
  samples (equal to the number of lights times the number of samples per area light)
  over the unit hemisphere. Then, I trace a ray from point \(p\)
  in the sampled direction and check if this new ray intersects
  another object. I get the emission value of the surface at
  the new point of intersection, which is non-zero if the new ray
  intersects a light source. Then, using the reflectance value calculated
  with <i>BSDF::f()</i> and the estimate of incoming light, I can use the
  reflection equation to calculate the amount of outgoing light with a
  Monte Carlo estimator. After adding up the contributions from all the
  sampled directions, I normalize by dividing by the number of samples and
  dividing by the value of the probability density function, which is
  \(1 / 2&#960\) since we sample over the unit hemisphere.

<h3>
  Compare the results between uniform hemisphere sampling and lighting sampling.
</h3>
<p>
  Uniform hemisphere sampling is somewhat slower than importance light sampling.
  For example, to render the Cornel Box bunny with -s 64 -l 32 (64 camera rays per
  pixel and 32 samples per area light), uniform hemisphere sampling takes about
  98 seconds, while importance sampling takes 84 seconds. However, importance sampling
  greatly reduces the noise levels when compared to uniform hemisphere sampling at the
  same sample rates.
  <br><br>
  For example, when rendering the Cornel Box bunny with a very low sampling rate,
  <i>-s 1 -l 1</i>, the image created with uniform hemisphere sampling is
  so noisy that the shape of the model is barely visible, and the scene is
  barely lit. In contrast, the image created with importance sampling is much clearer.

<h3>
  Walk through your implementation of the indirect lighting function.
</h3>
<p>
  For indirect lighting in the function <i>at_least_one_bounce_radiance()</i>,
  I first add the direct illumination from <i>one_bounce_radiance()</i> to \(L\_out\).
  Then, I sample one direction over the unit hemisphere in object space.
  I cast a ray from the given point \(hit\_p\) in the sampled direction.
  Before checking for any intersections, I compute the continuation probability,
  the \(cpdf\). The \(cpdf = 1\) if this is the first bounce and the maximum ray
  depth is greater than 1; we should trace at least one indirect bounce regardless
  of Russian roulette. Otherwise, if the current ray depth is greater than 1
  but this is not the first bounce, we terminate with probability 0.3, so the \(cpdf = 0.7\).
  I call the <i>coin_flip()</i> function with the \(cpdf\), and if it returns true,
  I check for an intersection between the new sample ray and another scene object.
  If there is an intersection, I recursively <i>call at_least_one_bounce_radiance()</i>
  with the new ray and new intersection point, then multiply by the reflectance
  and a cosine term, and normalize by both the \(pdf\) and the \(cpdf\).
  I add the contributed radiance to \(L\_out\) and return \(L\_out\).

  single pixel a fixed number of times.
  <br><br>
  I implemented adaptive sampling by modifying the <i>raytrace_pixel()</i> function.
  Each time I sample a pixel, I compute the illuminance from the radiance with
  <i>Vector3D::illum()</i> and track running totals for the sum of illuminances
  and the sum of squared illuminances. Every <i>samplesPerBatch</i> number of samples,
  I calculate the mean and standard deviation of the illuminance samples so far.
  Then, I calculate the value of \(I\) and check if it is less than or equal
  to the <i>maxTolerance</i> times the mean. If so, then this pixel has converged early.
  I stop sampling the pixel and update <i>sampleBuffer</i> with the estimated radiance and
  <i>sampleCountBuffer</i> with the total number of samples
  (less than the maximum possible number of samples).

  Here are CBspheres_lambertian.dae and CBbunny.dae rendered with 2048 samples per pixel,
  1 light ray, and max ray depth of 5. In the sampling rate image, red indicates
  that the pixel's value did not converge early, while blue indicates that the pixel's
  value converged early at a low sampling rate.
