<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
  <p>In this project, I implemented a rasterizer to render scalable vector graphics (SVG) file by drawing points,
  lines, or triangles to a framebuffer. Through this project, I've learned about multiple antialiasing techniques
  for reducing artifacts, including supersampling, pixel sampling, and mipmap level sampling.</p>

<h2 align="middle">Section I: Rasterization</h2>

<h3 align="middle">Part 1: Rasterizing single-color triangles</h3>

  <p> To rasterize a triangle given the coordinates of its three vertices, I sample over a range of pixels and check
    whether the point in the center of each pixel lies inside the triangle. This is done with a helper function
    <i>RasterizerImp::inside_triangle()</i> that performs the three-line point-in-triangle test. A point is inside the triangle if it lies above (or on)
    each of the three half-planes that define the triangle's edges, or if it lies below (or on) each of the three half-planes
    that define the triangle's edges. The non-strict inequality assumes that sample points lying
    on the edge of a triangle should be drawn and ensures that edges are rasterized, and the alternate condition accounts
    for cases where the vertices are provided in a clockwise winding order.
  </p>

  <p> To determine the range of pixels over which to sample, I calculate the minimum bounding box of the triangle by
    finding the minimum x- and y-values over all three coordinates (this is the upper left corner of the bounding box)
    and by finding the maximum x- and y-values over all three coordinates (this is the lower right corner of the bounding box).
    This algorithm checks each sample within the triangle’s bounding box in a nested for-loop.
  </p>

  <p>Figure 1 shows <i>svg/basic/test4.svg</i> with the default viewing parameters and the pixel inspector centered
    on the skinny corner of the red triangle. There is very apparent aliasing in the form of jaggies and gaps in the triangle.
  </p>

<br><br>

<h3 align="middle">Part 2: Antialiasing triangles</h3>

  <p>When the sample rate is changed by calling <i>RasterizerImp::set_sample_rate()</i>, I dynamically adjust the
    size of the <i>sample_buffer</i> array to be <i>length * width * sample_rate</i>, since each pixel will be
    supersampled a <i>sample_rate</i> number of times. Additionally, whenever <i>sample_buffer</i> needs to be resized,
    either in <i>set_sample_rate()</i> or <i>RasterizerImp::set_framebuffer_target()</i>, I also call
    <i>RasterizerImp::clear_buffers()</i> in order to clear the canvas.
  </p>

  <p>In <i>rasterize_triangle</i>, I still iterate over each pixel in the triangle’s bounding box.
    Given the upper left coordinates of the corner of a pixel and the sample rate, I iterate over each of its subpixels.
    If the center of the subpixel lies within the triangle, then I assign the corresponding element of the
    <i>sample_buffer</i> array to the given color; otherwise, the sample buffer’s default color is white.
    To properly render lines and points, in <i>RasterizerImp::fill_pixel()</i> I assign the same color to all
    subpixels corresponding to the given pixel coordinates.
  </p>

  <p>In <i>RasterizerImp::resolve_to_framebuffer()</i>, I iterate over each pixel of the screen and then iterate over
    each of its supersamples. I calculate the average color of the corresponding subpixels and write the value of
    each color channel to the RGB framebuffer.
  </p>

  <p>Supersampling is a useful antialiasing technique because it approximates finding the average color over a pixel.
    We sample at an artificially higher frequency than our final framebuffer, then downsample to create an image
    that has fewer, less apparent jaggies.

  <p>Figure 2.1 shows <i>svg/basic/test4.svg</i> at a supersampling rate of 1 per pixel. Figure 2.2 is at a supersampling rate
  of 4 per pixel. Figure 2.3 is at a supersampling rate of 16 per pixel. The skinny corner of the red triangle becomes
  much smoother as the sample rate increases. Supersampling allows pixel values to take on intermediate values,
  rather than completely red or completely white. This creates a blurred effect and higher image quality than
  what we observe without any supersampling. </p>

<h3 align="middle">Part 4: Barycentric coordinates</h3>

  <p>Barycentric coordinates provide us with a way to describe points within a triangle as a weighted sum of
    its three vertices. If we calculate the barycentric coordinates of a point in regular geometric space,
    we can use those weights to interpolate other values, such as colors or textures. Calculating a point’s
    barycentric coordinates can also be used to test whether the point lies inside the triangle; a point is
    inside the triangle if all three of its barycentric coordinate values (<i>alpha</i>, <i>beta</i>, <i>gamma</i>)
    are nonnegative.
  </p>

  <div align="middle">

  <p>In Figure 4, I plot a triangle with one red, one green, and one blue vertex.
    <i>RasterizerImp::rasterize_interpolated_color_triangle()</i> produces a triangle with a smooth
    blend of colors, where points are colored according to their barycentric coordinates.

<h3 align="middle">Part 5: "Pixel sampling" for texture mapping</h3>

  <p>Pixel sampling is a method that maps a texture image to screen coordinates. To rasterize a textured
    triangle given the coordinates of its vertices, I iterate over each pixel in the triangle’s bounding box.
    I find the geometric barycentric coordinates of each point <i>(x, y)</i> and then calculate its corresponding
    <i>(u, v)</i> coordinates using barycentric interpolation over the triangle. After scaling the
    <i>(u, v)</i> coordinates by the width and height of the appropriate mipmap, I can access the
    corresponding texture value (which is also a color vector) using <i>MipLevel::get_texel()</i>.
  </p>

  <p>Nearest neighbor sampling just rounds the scaled <i>(u, v)</i> coordinates to the nearest texel
    coordinates in order to get the texture value. Bilinear interpolation sampling looks at the four
    nearest sample locations (a 2x2 square) and performs linear interpolation in both the horizontal
    and vertical directions in order to get the texture value and the given <i>(u, v)</i> coordinates.
  </p>

  <div align="middle">
    <table style="width=100%">
      <tr>
        <td>
          <img src="../../docs/assets/images/task5_nearest1.png" align="middle" width="500px"/>

        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <table>
      <tr>
        <td>
          <img src="../../docs/assets/images/task5_nearest16.png" align="middle" width="500px"/>
          <figcaption align="middle">Figure 6.3: Nearest at 16 samples/pixel</figcaption>
        </td>

        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </div>

  <p>Bilinear sampling clearly performs better than nearest neighbor sampling when rasterizing
    smooth contours, such as the curves of the Berkeley seal and the shapes of letters. Bilinear sampling at 1
    sample/pixel performs about as well as nearest neighbor sampling at 16 samples/pixel.
    Noticeably, the “B” and “E” are significantly more legible when performing bilinear sampling.
    In these cases, bilinear sampling produces fewer jaggies than nearest neighbor sampling.
    Bilinear sampling will assign better intermediate values to pixels because it considers more
    information in the surrounding area for interpolation.
  </p>

  <br><br>

<h3 align="middle">Part 6: "Level sampling" with mipmaps for texture mapping</h3>

  <p>When rasterizing a textured triangle that appears further away, we can decrease render
    times and reduce aliasing by sampling from a lower resolution mipmap texture map. For texture mapping,
    I calculate the uv barycentric coordinates of <i>(x, y)</i>, <i>(x + 1, y)</i>, and <i>(x, y + 1)</i>. These coordinates are
    passed to <i>Texture::get_level()</i>, where I calculate and scale the difference vectors. The mipmap level <i>D</i>
    is equal to the base-2 logarithm of the larger delta magnitude.
  </p>

  <p>When <i>lsm == L_NEAREST</i>, I compute the value of <i>D</i> and round to the nearest whole number to
    find the appropriate mipmap level. When <i>lsm == L_LINEAR</i>, I compute <i>D</i> and find the texture
    values given by sampling from floor(</i>D</i>) and ceiling(<i>D</i>) mipmap levels.
    Then, I take a weighted sum of these two values to find the final texture value.
  </p>

  <p><i>Comparison of sampling techniques:</i><br>
    Supersampling is effective at reducing jaggies, but requires exponentially more memory as the
    sample rate is increased (assuming no engineering optimizations for the sample buffer array).
    Rasterization also slows down significantly when the sample rate increases.</p>
  <p>Pixel sampling always uses the highest resolution texture map, which can have negative impacts on
    performance when the texture appears at a distance because many many texels fit into the size of a
    single pixel. Bilinear sampling tends to produce smoother results with less aliasing than nearest neighbor sampling.
  </p>
  <p>When surfaces are at a further distance, level sampling can reduce aliasing better than pixel sampling.
    Storing mipmaps is also fairly memory efficient, requiring only 33% more space than the full resolution
    texture map to store all the mipmap levels.

  <p>Figures 7.1 - 7.4 show four versions of the image of a small green shell, with different
  combinations of level sampling and pixel sampling. Figure 7.1 has the most aliasing, with
  many apparent jaggies, while Figure 7.4 has the smoothest look with very little aliasing.
  Figure 7.2 is slightly smoother than 7.3, since 7.2 uses bilinear pixel sampling instead of
  nearest neighbor pixel sampling.</p>
